                    The HIV/AIDS epidemic is destroying families and entire cultures throughout Africa.  But in Uganda, there is hope. This East African Republic long ago built a coalition of government, churches and schools that has worked to dramatically slow the spread of HIV/AIDS and offer relief to infected victims.                  
                    More than a million people have died here since the disease began, leaving over 1.5 million children without parents.
                    Though Ugandans have taken in more than 700,000 orphans as their own children, some 800,000 are left to care for themselves. Juna Amagara Ministries was founded in 2004 to help these children grow in Christ to become healthy, productive members of society. Juna Amagara means "Save Life."
